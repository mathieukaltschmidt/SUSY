\section{Overview}
\begin{frame}{What have we learned so far and what needs to be discussed?}
\addtocounter{framenumber}{-1}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{State of the Art:} We \alert{promoted the SM to the MSSM-124} and found a variety of new degrees of freedom that need to be taken into account in further investigations.\\[1em]
	\item Now we want to understand how to make sense of a theoretical model with $\mathcal{O}(100)$ parameters.\\[1em]
	\item \textbf{Central Question:} Is it possible to reduce this huge number of parameters to a reasonable number that may be tested in future experiments?\footnote{Experimental details $\rightarrow$ talk next week!}\\[1em]
	\item \textbf{Phenomenology of the MSSM}: Focus on the \enquote{pMSSM} and Gauge Coupling Unification.\\[1em]
	\item Which problems are still present? Why might the \enquote{minimal} SSM not be enough?
\end{itemize}
